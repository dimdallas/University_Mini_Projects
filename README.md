# University_Mini_Projects
Few of the most interesting and creative mini projects on my way to learn programming.

## Draw Church
The program is about drawing a church and its chapel.
It takes 2 integers as input,
one for the height of the church and
one for the windows of the chapel.
The program was scripted for Programming 101 of my University.
The point is to play with ASCII characters while while implementing
double-nested and triple-nested loops

## Mine Sweeper
Terminal version of classic Mine Sweeper game.
Player chooses difficulty level that affects board size.
Game iterates and Player chooses a row and a column (bassically a cell).
If cell contains a mine, game is over.
If row #0 is chosen, game exits.
If all cells not containing a mine are revealed, PLayer wins.
Whenever game terminates, player is asked to restart.

## File Base
FileBase.c is a program for 
creating and managing custom database-like files.
These databases can import various file types.
The point is to store many files simultaneously in a single database file.

Function overview:
Import file
   * By pressing "1" and typing the filename or the filepath.
   * If two filepaths ends up in the same filename, it will assume it is
   * the same file, thus asking you to replace it.
Search file
   * By pressing "2" and typing part of the filename.
   * A list of files containing this part is printed.
Export file
   * By pressing "3" and typing filename existing in database.
   * The program asks you to type the filename for the exported file.
   * A new file is being created with the specified filename.
   * Note: You are responsible for assigning correct file extension.
Delete file
   * By pressing "4" and typing filename existing in database.
